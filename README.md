## *_printf.c project*

 

### Description:
The code in `main.c` implements a custom `printf` function, `_printf`, which replicates the behavior of the standard `printf` function in C. It allows you to print formatted output to the console.

### Usage:
To use the `_printf` function, you have to include the header files: `main.h` and `formatspecs.h`. The `main.h` header file contains function prototypes and necessary definitions. The `formatspecs.h` likely contains the definitions of format specifiers and their printing functions.
